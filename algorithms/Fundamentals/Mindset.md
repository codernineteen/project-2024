- Make test cases and validate if our solution is right with those.
- We need a strong background of algorithms and data structures 
- To improve problem solving skill, we need to solve lots of problem about a certain algorithm topic (ex, arrays, strings and so on)
- To improve implementation skill, we need to compare our code with others. By doing so, we can remove unneccessary parts in our code.

# constraints
---
- time constraints - 300,000,000 ~ 500,000,000 operations per second
- space constraints - mostly 256MB
- consider integer overflow
