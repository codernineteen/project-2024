- If we need constant time insertion and removal of arbitrary elements in a problem, linked list data structure is good choice.

# Cpp doubly linked list STL

- `#include <list>`
- an interator in list is invalidated only when the corresponding element is deleted.
- Element access
	- front()
	- back()
- Iterators
	- begin
	- end
- modifier
	- erase(iterator pos)
