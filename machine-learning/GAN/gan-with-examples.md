# 1. What is Generative Adeversarial Networks

There are two modelings in ML, DL field.
- generative modeling
	1. need a model to reproduce desirable ground truths.
	2. prepare train and test data.
	3. train
	4. infer the result based on the examples (check the functionality by a specific metrics which is called similarity)
- discriminative modeling
	1. create convolution layers to understand divisions in data, or create a model that use pretrained features.
	2. prepare training set and test set
	3. train the model
	4. predict which classes an input fit into.
	- ex ) classification

Generative modeling has much more difficulties compared to dicriminative modeling.
