Two perspective to describe Internet.
1. describe hardware and software components of Internet.
2. networking infrastructure term.


# 1.1 What is Internet
## 1.1.1 Components term of internet

### End systems (host) 
 - sender host system :
	- have a data to send to receiver.
	- separate the data into several **segements** unit.
	- attach a header to a single segment 
		-> this (header + segment) is called 'packet'.
- receiver host system :
	- reassemble data that it received.

### communication link & packet switch (physical media)
- these links enables the host to be connected with each other.
	- Each link uses various transmission rate (**link bandwidth**)
	- The transmission rate is represented as BPS, which is an abbreviation of 'Bits per second'

### Packet switch
1. router in the network core.
2. link-layer switch at the entrance of network.

### ISP (Internet Service Provider)
- An ISP is a network that is composed of packet switch and communication link.
- There are many kinds of ISP : home ISP, instituition ISP, univ ISP and so on.
- some of them provide cellular data
- To provide connection entrances to hosts of Internet, each of ISP should be connected to each other either.

### Protocol
- a promise between two peers.
	- The peer that i mentioned here is not the host exactly.
	- It can be physical interface peer, router peer or application peer.
	- A certain protocol is defined for one of the specific peers.
- control communication

## 1.1.2 Service term of Internet

Internet is an infrastructure that provides a various type of services to end systems.

Example of services :
- email
- web surfing
- internet video call,
- streaming
- social media

These services have many end systems , so it is called as 'distributed application'.
The key point is that it starts from end-system, not packet switch. (**packet switch here just do a role of helper to make data communication easier.**)

Then how an end system sends a data from its application layer to the receiver to whom it want to send the data? Through Socket interface!

## Socket interface

Internet socket interface is a set of protocols that send program should follow.
The socket interface do actual sending data by calling apis of bottom layer of it.


## 1.1.3 So What is Protocol actually?

In a conversation between two humans, we have a set of protocol to talk with the other person.

For example, If the person start dancing after my greeting, i can't proceed the conversation anymore by following our protocol because i don't know what the person is doing right now.


For a protocal to be valid, it requires more than two entitiy know about the specifications of the protocol.

## 1.1.4 protocol in the perspective of network

Computer network protocol is very similar to human conversation protocol. The only difference is that it is protocol for softwares.

ex) 
1. End system protocol
	- control packet transmission rate
2. Router protocol 
	- set a route from source to destination
3. LAN-card protocol
	- control bit flow on the connected link. (for example, error detection)

Protocol define not only the format and order of message exchanged by entities , but also behaviors depending on set of events.


# 1.3 Network core

## 1.3.1 packet exchange

- end systems exchange application message
- application messages are big, so we need to separate them into several packets.
- **Each packet are sent to receiver while following maximum transmission rate.**
	- For example send a L-bit packet with speed of R (bit / sec) 
		-> it requires $\frac{L}{R}$ secconds to send it.

### store & forward transmission
- the core of packet switching network.
- This transmission technique means that a switch **==need to buffer== all of the packets** related to a single data **before sending a bit to** **output link**
- If there are three nodes (A,B and C)
	At the point of B received the first packet from node A, node A already started sending next packet.
	By assuming that there is no the propagation delay, it will takes $N\frac{L}{R}$ delay, where $N$ is a number of links from source to destination and $R$ is transmission rate.

### ==Queuing delay and packet loss==

- a packet switch has several **input links** and **output buffer**
- In addition to 'store & forward' delay, a packet is suffered from queueing delay because of buffering.
- If the output buffer is full, packet loss ocucrs. (because there is no memory space to store newly incoming packets.)
- In below image, incoming links has 100M bps bandwidth and output link has 10M bps. ==When arrival rate is over output transmission rate, there will be congestion in router and need to queue packets in the buffer==
	 ![](../../images/Pasted%20image%2020240417180133.png)


### Forwarding table and routing protocol
Two core functions of computer network.

- Forwarding table : map destination address to an output link.
- Routing algorithm : determines a direction in which the packet need to go.
- Routing protocol : By communicating adjacent routers, a router determines some of shortest paths and update forwarding table.


### Packet Switching vs Circuit Switching

Case study
- 1 Mbps shared link by user.
- total time : T
- each user use the link only 10% of total time T. (0.1T)

If a method of exchange messages is 'circuit switching', 100kbps ($\frac{1}{10}Mbps$) bandwidth should be reserved for each users.

On the other hand , in the 'packet switching' case, each user can use the link with better user experience.

- a probability of a single user to use the link at any time : $P(i=active)=0.1$
- By generalizing it, k-users use a link at the same time(total users : n)
  $$P(active =k) = nC_k(0.1)^k(0.9)^{n-k}$$
For example, probability of more than arbitrary eleven users use the link at the same time is :
  $$P(active \le 10) = \sum_{i=0}^{k}P(active=i)$$
  $$P(active > 10)= 1-\sum_{i=0}^{k}P(active=i)$$
  Above equation is derived by culmulative distribution function in discrete domain.

But as we've already mentioned, there can be excessive congestion if many users use the link as much as it exceeds output link transmission rate.


### ==Network of networks==

- ISP make end-systems connect to Internet.
- ISP should be connected to each other to make e2e communication possible.
- Network structure 5 :
	![](../../images/Pasted%20image%2020240417192824.png)
	1. At the leaf position, there are access ISP
	2. Access ISP connects to Regional ISP
	3. Each Regional ISP connects to Tier 1 ISP (This is real ISP unlike imaginary global ISP)
	- Adjacent ISPs can peer each other.
	- Content provide network works independently. Some of big tech company like Google build their own networks to provide their contents to users.
		But still many Access ISP can only reaches Tier 1 ISP , Content provider is also connected to Tier 1 ISP. 


# 1.4 Delay, loss and throughput in networks


## Delay
In packet switching network, we do store & forward(==transmission delay==) and require queuing for the case that incoming transmission rate exceeds output rate(==queueing delay==).

Here are four main delay in packet switching network.
1. $d_{proccess}$ : processing delay
	- check bit errors
	- run routing algorithm
	- typically a few microseconds
2. $d_{transmission}$ : transmission delay
	- L : packet lengths as bits
	- R : link bandwidth (R bits per second)
	- delay is $\frac{L}{R}$
3. $d_{queue}$ : queuing delay
	- time waiting at output link for transmission
	- depends on level of congestion (number of incoming packets.)
	- often takes a big part of total nodal delay.
4. $d_{prop}$ : propagation delay
	- a delay depends on length of link (D) and propagation speed (s)
	- $\frac{D}{s}$
5. $d_{nodal} = d_{proc} + d_{prop} + d_{tran} + d_{queue}$

==Note1 : There is an explicit difference between propagation delay and transmission== delay.
The transmission delay is not related to distance, but propagation is.
One the other hand, transmission delay is related to tranmission rate, but propagation isn't.

Note2 : Different packet has different delay
For example, last packet of data will have higher queueing delay than former packets.

**Traffic intensity**
- Assumptions :
	- average arrival rate of packet : a (packets/sec)
	- transmission rate : R (bits/sec)
	- length of every packets : L
	- queue has infinite capacity
	Then, average arrival rate of bit  is $La(bits/sec)$
	Traffic intensity is ratio between this average arrival rate of bit and transmission rate.
	Therefore,  $La/R$ 

If Traffice intensity is larger than 1, it means that the system is unstable.	
Because of one of the assumption "queue has infinite capacity", packets will be queued infinitely and queuing delay increases infitely either.

==It is really important to design a system that has traffice intensity lower or equal to 1==

Example ) 
- $La/R \le 1$ 
- N packets arrives at entrance for every $(L/R)N$ seconds
- What is average queuing delay of this case ?
	- first packet doesn't have any delay
	- Let's say $La/R = 1$, then second packet have $(L/R)$ delay. 
	- So on, Nth packet will have $(N-1)(L/R)$ delay.
	- Then average queuing delay is sum of all delay and divide it by total number of packet that have queuing delay.
		$$avg(d_{queue}) = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}k(L/R)}{N}=\frac{N(L/R)(N-2)}{2N}$$

## Packet loss

If a router can't hold incoming packets, it **'drops'** them.

There are main three reasons of packet loss :
1. Link loss
	- bit error
	- noise in the link
	- Nowadays it rarely happens in wired network, but still wireless network is suffered from link loss.
2.  Queue loss
	- If queue is full, router discards incoming packet.
3. Drop
	- If it not mine ? ignore
	- cycle detected, TTL expires
	- If a router don't know where to send it.
	- If a packet seems to have malicious purpose. 

Equations :
- Bit error : $p_{b}$ 
- No bit error : $1-p_b$
- packet error rate(L bits per pacekt) : $P_{pac} = 1-P_{pac_no_err} = 1- (1-p_b)^L= p_b^L$


### Throughput in Computer network

Case study )
Assumption :
- Client and server only fill the pipe with bits.
- Transmission rate of server : $R_s$
- Transmission rate of router : $R_c$
- If $R_s < R_c$, the client will experience throughput with $R_S$
- If $R_s > R_c$, the client will experience throughput with $R_c$, also there will be increasing queuing delay.
- If file size is 32,000,000 bits, $R_s$ is 2Mbps and $R_c$ is 1Mbps, Then approximately the time needs to send the file will be :
	$$\frac{File \space size}{min(R_s, R_c)} = \frac{32,000,000 bits}{1Mbps}=32seconds$$

![](../../images/Pasted%20image%2020240417215100.png)

This case study implies that the bottleneck link can vary depending on throughput of links participating in the communication.
# 1.5 Protocol layers and Service model

At this section, the main topic is the structure of network itself.

## 1.5.1 Hierachical structure

- Align the steps required to send and receive data between end systems.
- Then we can extract functionality from each steps and can make it as layer.

Let's take an example of flight.
From buy a ticket to arrived at destination airport, there are a sequence of steps we need to pass.
But at the same time, there is certainly middle point of the steps which divde the sequence into two parts and make them as reflection of each other.
That is, flight routing !

Computer network has similar structure to above example.

### layering protocols.

If we separate a total system into several layers, we can compose service model of system.
The service model means that each layer has its own service and provides it to the layers who need the service.

## Traditional model - OSI 7-Layer
Note that below model is not used in Internetworking.
- protocol stack of a single end system
![](../../images/Pasted%20image%2020240417221613.png)
- protocol diagram that includes two end systems and access routers of them
![](../../images/Pasted%20image%2020240417221631.png)


## Internet protocol stack
![](../../images/Pasted%20image%2020240417233507.png)

### application layer (unit : message)
- HTTP - web docs related 
- SMTP - email
- FTP - end system file transfer

### Transport layer (unit : segment)
- message transfer between client and server
- ==TCP==
	- connection oriented
	- reliable transfer
	- stream-based
	- congestion control
- UDP
	- unreliable, connectionless
	- datagram-based

### Network layer (IP protocol, unit : datagram)
- responsible for routing datagrams from one host to the other. 
- take a segment from sender transport layer
- route the segment forward the receiver transport layer.

### Link layer (unit : frame)
- datagram routing between source and dest through packet switch.
- link service is dependent on linke protocol adoption.
- provide reliable link transfer (different from TCP reliability)

### Physical layer
- transfer unit in physical layer is a bit
- this layer rely on physical links.
- Fiber, Coax cable can be used as link
- air medium is used for wireless link.

## 1.5.2 Packet encapsulation

Upper layer message is encapsulated as payload of lower layer and lower layer attach their header to payload. Then, new packet is generated.
